# MongoDB VS RavenDB

Soon I'll start to work on a new personal project which will use as a data store a NoSQL database. After a preliminary documentation I've stopped on choosing between MongoDB and RavenDB. Each solution has some advantages over its rival and till now it's a tie, but frankly i tend to choose MongoDB(you know all the free,mature ...). But for being able to choose the best solution for me, I have to test them both, so let the battle begin ! 

In the next post I'll share what were the results and to what conclusion they led.

this.page.url = 2011/10/08/mongodb-vs-ravendb;  // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable
this.page.identifier = mongodb-vs-ravendb; // Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable
};
