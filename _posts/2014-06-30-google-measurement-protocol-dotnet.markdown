# Google Measurement Protocol .Net Library

In case you need to gather information for Google Analytics from the back-end of your application, Google provides [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/)  which permits through http requests to send data which can be interpreted by the Google Analytics engine. I've published a library **GoogleMeasurementProtocol** which can help you to create Measurement Protocol requests. More details you can find on [Github](https://github.com/ion-sapoval/google-measurement-protocol-dotnet) .
